Introduction
============
Pyseldon provides a simple interface for Opinion Dynamics simulations. It is designed to be easy to use and to provide a simple way to run simulations and analyze the results.
The package provides a set of classes that implement different models of opinion dynamics. It is a compiled package, so it is fast and efficient. The package is written in C++ and binded with Pybind11 to provide a Python interface.
Some of the models that are implemented in the package are:

- DeGroot Model
- Deffuant Model
- Deffuant Vector Model
- Activity Driven Model
- Inertial Model
